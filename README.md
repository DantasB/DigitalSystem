# ULA

A simple ALU constructed using VHDL made by Bruno Dantas, Guilherme Bergman and Jo√£o Ricardo.

The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a simple digital dispositive that's able to realize logic operations and arithmetics. It's a important circuit on Central Processing Unit (CPU), that composes even the simplest CPU. It consists in a big "electronic calculator" that the tecnology was available before the computer.



## Important 
This code is a College work that have some requirements:
1. The ALU needs to have at least 8 operations that sum and subtraction are necessary.
2. The input needs to be inserted by the FPGA keys.
3. May contains 4 Flags: Zero, Overflow, Signal, Carry.
